      "\n",
      "**Topic:** Performance comparison of Lakebase and SQL Warehouse for low-latency operations in Databricks Apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Databricks Apps:** Feature released in the second half of 2024, enables users to create dashboards and data apps directly on Databricks.\n",
      "*   **Performance Bottleneck:** Using SQL Warehouse for frequent read/write operations in real-time data apps can result in latencies of several seconds, negatively impacting user experience.\n",
      "*   **Lakebase Advantage:** Lakebase consistently outperforms SQL Warehouse in low-latency scenarios, making it better suited for real-time applications.\n",
      "*   **Speedup:** The performance advantage of Lakebase is most noticeable with small batch sizes. Large-scale bulk operations show diminishing returns.\n",
      "*   **SQL Warehouse Use Cases:** SQL Warehouse remains a viable option when latency is not a primary concern or when specific features outweigh performance considerations.\n",
